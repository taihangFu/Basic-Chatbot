The main reason is to is to treat all words on an equal footing and allow for uniform processing. For instance, lower or upper case doesn't chage the meaning of a given word, it is not worth to create a extra vocab for 2 word which are exactly the same. Removing puntuationa and another non-alphabet also an essential step s since they can be intrepred as nosie, as they themself are not word and has no meaning at all.\n","\n","\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"QLjf_pm9NiA8","colab_type":"code","colab":{}},"source":["# Please comment your code"],"execution_count":0,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"GXgFpxIgl-_G","colab_type":"text"},"source":["### 2.1.2.
